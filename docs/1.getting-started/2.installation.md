## Quick start
Before you begin, make sure you have one of the following runtime environments installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) >= 22.0.0
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) >= 1.2.0
- [Deno](https://deno.land) >= 2.0.0

::steps
  ### Create a new project
  The easiest way to get started with Vercube is to use the official project generator:
  ::code-group
    ```bash [pnpm]
    $ pnpm create vercube@latest
    ```
    ```bash [npm]
    $ npx create-vercube@latest
    ```
    ```bash [bun]
    $ bun create vercube
    ```
  ::

  ### Start the development server
  After creating the project, navigate to the project directory and start the development server:
  ::code-group
    ```bash [pnpm]
    $ pnpm dev
    ```
    ```bash [npm]
    $ npm run dev
    ```
    ```bash [bun]
    $ bun run dev
    ```
  ::

  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your Vercube application running!

  ::tip
  The development server will automatically reload the page when you make changes to your code.
